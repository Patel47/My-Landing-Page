# My-Landing-Page

Hello Everyone
In this project I created a landing page which is display Your name with greeting massage based on time and allow user to store the massage or task of the day.
This massage store in your computer's local storage, using Web Storage API.
This massage is still there in local storage after closing the browser, because it is not a session storage.
The next thing is the background image is change based on time.
